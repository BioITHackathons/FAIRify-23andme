A project developed in the Bio-IT FAIR Data Hackathon

## Self-evaluation
How well does 23andme data align with FAIR data principles?  

For each of the 15 FAIR principles, rate your dataset before and after your hackathon work.  A rating of "1" is least FAIR; "5" is most FAIR.

### Findable
> F1. (meta)data are assigned a globally unique and persistent identifier
* Before: 
* After:

> F2. data are described with rich metadata (defined by R1 below)
* Before: 
* After:

> F3. metadata clearly and explicitly include the identifier of the data it describes
* Before: 
* After:

> F4. (meta)data are registered or indexed in a searchable resource
* Before: 
* After:

### Accessible
> A1. (meta)data are retrievable by their identifier using a standardized communications protocol
* Before: 
* After:

> A1.1 the protocol is open, free, and universally implementable
* Before: 
* After:

> A1.2 the protocol allows for an authentication and authorization procedure, where necessary
* Before: 
* After:

> A2. metadata are accessible, even when the data are no longer available
* Before: 
* After:

### Interoperable
> I1. (meta)data use a formal, accessible, shared, and broadly applicable language for knowledge representation.
* Before: 
* After:

> I2. (meta)data use vocabularies that follow FAIR principles
* Before: 
* After:

> I3. (meta)data include qualified references to other (meta)data
* Before: 
* After:

### Reusable
> R1. meta(data) are richly described with a plurality of accurate and relevant attributes
* Before: 
* After:

> R1.1. (meta)data are released with a clear and accessible data usage license
* Before: 
* After:

> R1.2. (meta)data are associated with detailed provenance
* Before: 
* After:

> R1.3. (meta)data meet domain-relevant community standards
* Before: 
* After:
